2008-03-17  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@sverker-laptop>

	* Several files, to make it complie without warnings in 32 bit
	  mode. 
	  NyBit is now defined depending on __LP64__ and uses long or int
	  depending on the architecture. Remains to test in 64 bit again...

	* src/sets/bitset.h: using __LP64__ macro to indirectly define internal
	  conditional flags, NyBits_32 resp. NyBits_64
	
	*  guppy/heapy/__init__.py : checked sys.maxint to detmine arch
	   some size-dependent tests are relaxed if not 32-bit arch
	*  guppy/heapy/test_heapyc.py : relaxed a timing test
	
	* src/sets/nodeset.c &c. changed some more occurences of int to NyBit
	  or perhaps they just became long in some place.

2008-03-13  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@sverker-laptop>
	*  Starting modifications to work with 64 bits.
	*  guppy/src/sets/ (bitset.h, nodeset.c, bitset.c), maybe others,
	changes to especially the index type used as bit number in bitsets.
	Defining type NyBit for this and also NySize. They are just
	longs right now. Testing with Ubuntu 7.10 / AMD 64. 

2007-02-16  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* Put it under svn. Changed to call it 0.1.7 in README and ANNOUNCE

2007-01-31  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* guppy/gsl/XHTML.py (Node2XHTML.visit_comment): Made it not
	output anything to the XHTML file.

2007-01-25  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* guppy/gsl/Document.py (_GLUECLAMP_.output_handlers): Added XHTML entry
	(Document.visit_output): Made the output mode specification case-insensitive.

	* guppy/gsl: Added XHTML.py module - initially a copy of Html.py.
	I am changing to be more conventional(?) - to use all upper case
	in the XHTML name since that is how it is written looks in
	documents on the web. (Is this contrary to Python conventions to
	use Capitalized names?) But it would be too weird to write Xhtml
	(or even worse XHtml) vs XHTML. 
	
2006-11-08  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* guppy/gsl/Html.py (Node2Html.__init__): Changed (default,
	still fixed) encoding to utf-8.


	Version 0.1.6
	
2006-10-13  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* guppy/heapy/Use.py (_GLUECLAMP_._get_Root): This is what the
	method should have been called, not get_RS that it became
	yesterday.

	Version 0.1.5
	
2006-10-12  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* guppy/gsl/Document.py: Made some changes wrt dl/dt/dd to make
	the generated HTML code be more standards compliant, fixing
	rendering problems occuring AFAIK at least using Firefox.
	
	* guppy/gsl/Html.py: Fixed a problem with generated comments.
	
	* guppy/heapy/Remote.py (on): Made the site module be imported
	before Remote, to make it work in a normal installation when
	PYTHONPATH does not contain the guppy package. Had to change the
	recursion stopping flag to not be in the Remote module; now put in
	sys.

	(Annex) made h be a shorthand for hp in the remote interpreter, to
	be consistent with new abridged example style.
	
	* guppy/heapy/UniSet.py: Made sp be a shorthand for shpaths,
	because it is such a commonly used attribute.
	
	* guppy/heapy/[test_Path,test_ER].py : Made check of test results
	fit changes made to Path.py resp. Use.py
	
	* guppy/heapy/Use.py : Added RS attribute, to work with changes
	in Path.py. Changed default reprefix to be 'hpy().' , to be more
	meaningful in most cases.
	
	* guppy/heapy/Path.py (_GLUECLAMP_.shpgraph): Made the source name
	be derived from the Root attribute of the global hpy() instance in
	the normal case when the root is RootSTate -- to describe the path
	unambiguosly and show how it may be used.

	Version 0.1.4
	
2006-10-11  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* guppy/heapy/View.py (obj_at): Uses new obj_at method in
	immnodeset objects, to handle compatibility issues between Python
	versions and also be much faster.

	(referrers): After updating referrers, now checks that the domain
	of referrer graph was really covering the objects it should, and
	otherwise prints an error message and calls the debugger. -- I
	don't know when this should happen, the problem might have been
	due to a compilation version error, but I am letting the check
	left in.
	
	* guppy/etc/Glue.py: Checked ImportError message to see if it was
	a clean ImportError (No module named %s) in which case it proceeds
	as usual but otherwise the error is reported (showing the cause of
	the error)

	Changed '0x%x' to hex() to get rid of a compatibility warning
	
	Added more informative message text when an AttributeError is
	raised from getting an attribute from a module.
	
	* src/heapy/stdtypes.c (frame_relate): Replaced use of f_nlocals,
	f_ncells and f_nfreevars with values calculated from tuple sizes
	and co_nlocals, because in 2.5 the fields are removed in frames.
	(frame_traverse): Similarly removed use of f_nlocals.
	
	(type_traverse and type_relate): Changed name of slots to ht_slots
	if Python version >= 2.5.

	* src/sets/bitset.c: Removed use of type intintargfunc which is
	depreciated in Python2.5. 

	* src/sets/immnodeset.c: Added obj_at method to immutable
	nodesets, to solve problems occuring when using id() in different
	versions of Python (2.5 sometimes returns long ints) in the obj_at
	method in View.py; the C method is cleaner and much faster based
	on binary search.

	* src/sets/nodeset.c: Made a pointer comparison compare cast to
	Py_uintptr_t instead of pointers directly, to be more well defined
	since the pointers are to different objects.
	Removed the use of type intintargfunc which is depreciated in
	Python2.5. 


2006-10-09  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* guppy/heapy/test/test_Classifiers.py: Increased the number of
	loops in a time test from 10 to 100 to get better precision on
	faster machines. Removed a few tests that failed in newer Python
	depending on different object representation. Changed the use of 
	er.classifier.partition(li.nodes) to li.by(er).partition to make
	a testcloser to what would be used by the user. Added a debug
	parameter to test_main.
	
	* guppy/heapy/test/test_ER.py: Removed / commented out the many
	printouts, added missing tests when feasible, changed assert
	statements to self.assert_ calls, changed initial comments in test
	methods to doc strings to make test printout more informative.
	

	* guppy/heapy/test/test_heapyc.py: Removed some timing
	printouts. I think I could add some tests there instead but it is
	tricky to be portable and stable.
	

	* guppy/heapy/test/test_Path.py (chkrel): Made it handle the case
	where several relation edges were found, despite only one was
	originally expected, because this happened because of sharing
	introduced (likely by some optimization) in Python 2.5. Added
	debug parameter to test_main and run_test.

	* guppy/heapy/test/Use.py: Added test() method which will test all
	of heapy - easier to remember and write than ... whatever I had to
	write before.
	
2006-10-05  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* guppy/heapy/Classifiers.py: Uses str2int for conversion to
	handle differences between Python versions.

	* guppy/etc/etc.py: Added str2int function to have a single place
	to handle conversion of (hexadecimal) strings to integers - as it
	became more complicated when handling all Python versions 2.3 -
	2.5.

	
2006-10-02  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>
	
	* guppy/gsl/SpecNodes.py: Added get_arg method. Changed a use of 0
	to False for clarity. Corrected context handling in
	errmsg_context. Made get_line open a read from a file when
	possible. 
	
2006-07-21  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* Changed the comment in docexample so as to show that comments do
	not need to have .c at the beginning of each line.
	( Noting that the generated document seems a bit 'naked' can use
	some more heading and some back-link to top, next etc.

2006-06-22  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* In gsl/Html.py, generalized the handling of header tags
	to allow for spec of links. Added charset specification
	to comply with W3C tests.

	Version 0.1.3
	
2006-03-02  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* In View, changed usage ArgSet -> Kind

2006-02-17  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* In Remote.py, changed the on() function to not do anything if it
	was called from within the annex thread itself. Changed RM.py to
	NOT do this check. (Structural/implementation cleanup details.)

	* In UniSet, changed name ArgSet -> Kind
	  (Implementation / documentation detail)

2006-02-14  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* Fixed bug with array sizing for Python 2.4 (in stdtypes.h)
	  Added test for this case (to test_View.py)
	
2006-02-07  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	*  Added type_traverse to stdtypes
	   because the GC one didnt work with 2.4.2 in debug mode 
	   (It checked for heap type with assert.)
	* Changed usages of '0x%x'%addr to hex(addr) to make valid
	  hex literals in Python2.4.

2006-02-06  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* Added Monitor command to interrupt the remote process.
	  (The ki command.) It can still not interrupt it at all times.

	* Made end of file exit the monitor. (Otherwise may be infinite
	  loop for file input)

	* Made Monitor use threading rather than thread because the
	  program exited more cleanly in newer Pythons for some reason.
	
	
2006-02-05  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* Reverted the change to heapg but added a depreciated warning
	* Added the heapu method - a slightly better name
	  It finds the referred objects i.e. strings as well
	* Made the representation of a Stat indicate itself as such
	  to differentiate from repr of sets.
	* Made the sort order of stat diff be what it claimed (largest
	first)
	* Fixed Monitor so it passes empty commands along
	  so multi-line commands can be used in remote interpreter.
	* Changed the command string for quitting an interactive console
	  since 'q' is valid syntax
	  changed to: '-'
	
2006-02-03  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>
	
	* Added priming of list and tuple iterators
	  so their slot wrappers dont suddenly show up unreachable.
	* Made heapg return just  .byclass.stat
	  to safeguard against common subtle problems.
	* Added one-time initialization in View.heap
	* Added ref option to reference pattern creator
	* Dropped the usage of 'observation containers' in heapg
	  since it is too brittle.
	* Uncommented call to deletecommand in fixed Menu in Prof.py
	* Added dump method to IdentitySet
	* Added Use.setrel
	
2006-02-01  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* Made help text of get_rp use shorter lines and added some
	  missing help text. Wrapped some other program lines.
	* Stopkind in rp should be independent on classifier
	  try eg using er=h.Type. Change to RefPat.
	
2006-01-23  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker@localhost>

	* Added some comments to C code (heapdef.h)
	* Have added some method to SpecNode (copy)
	

	0.1.2
	
2006-01-17  Sverker Nilsson  <sverker.is@home.se>

	Primary Bugs

	* Fixed a pointer comparison bug in nodegraph.c ,
	  which made a test fail in my new system
	  (with Linux 2.6.12-9-386) and could effect the outcome
	  of algorithms such as the shortest path.

	* Fixed the address comparison in View.obj_at so it
	  handles unsigned addresses.

	Test Portability Issues

	* Made test_via in test_Classifiers work in Python 2.4
	  getting around the optimization of tuple constants.
	* Relaxed guppy.heapy.test.test_Classifiers.RenderCase
	  since it was picky and list size changed in Python 2.4 .
	* Relaxed test_Path.test_nodeset_relation
	  since it wasn't portable across different kernel versions.
	* Fixed a test bug in sets/test.py where the range
	  step became zero with faster=0.
