I am happy to announce Guppy 3 3.1.6

Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.

This release adds support for Python 3.14, and support for Python 3.9
was dropped. Support for free-threaded mode is planned for a future
release.

This release also fixes a few bugs, including:

o Fix a segfault in hv_cli_inrel_classify caused by a GC race
o Fix relate of frame objects showing some attributes as exposed Python
  when they are not
