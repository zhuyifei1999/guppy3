I am happy to announce Guppy 3 3.1.4

Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.

This release adds support for Python 3.12, and support for Python 3.7
was dropped.

This release also fixes a few bug fixes, including:

o Fix refcount sanity assertion for Python 3.11, when C asserts are
  compiled in.
o Fix INTERATTR definition, where for "internal attributes" it would
  always report the attribute name as "newname".
o Fix .referrers occasionally returning empty set due to GC race
