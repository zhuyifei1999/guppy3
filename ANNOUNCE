I am happy to announce Guppy 3 3.1.5

Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.

This release adds support for Python 3.13, and support for Python 3.8
was dropped.

Code for Remote & Monitor has been removed since it no longer worked since
Python 3.9 (I hope PEP 734 will change this in the future). Other libraries
such as aiomanhole might provide similar functionality with a much simpler
implementation.

This release also fixes a few bugs, including:

o Fix -Wmissing-braces compile warning
o Added some error handling code paths to bitset
